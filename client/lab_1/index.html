    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of
      text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the
      text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em>
    </p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br />
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br />
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks
    to match your page to the sample.

    <h2>Images</h2>

    <p>
      Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for
      accessibility.
    </p>
    <img src="images/images/mochi.jpg" alt="mochi jpg" />
    <img src="images/images/mochi.png" alt="mochi png" />
    <img src="images/images/mochi.svg" alt="mochi svg" />
    <img src="images/images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi gif" />
